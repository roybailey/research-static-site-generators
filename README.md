Research static site generators


## Motivation

**Mono-repo to try out a couple of static site generators for the generation of a gh-pages documentation site.**

Mostly interested to avoid installing software that may be difficult or prohibited at large enterprises.
For that reason we have looked mostly at self contained JavaScript frameworks.


## Getting started

**Visit any of the sub-folder projects to see the framework sample**


## Handover Suggestions

_Nuggets of Knowledge and Thinking from last people to work on the project._
_e.g. suggestions for technical debt reduction, simplification or enhancements_
